This error typically occurs when there's a mismatch between the project's configuration (e.g., `package.json`, `app.json`, `eas.json`) and the Expo CLI's expectations.  It can manifest in various ways, often related to missing dependencies, incorrect versions, or conflicts between Expo modules and native code.  For example, you might see an error if you're using a native module that isn't correctly linked or if your `app.json` file specifies a plugin that isn't installed.
