The solution depends on the specific error encountered.  Common fixes include:

* **Checking `package.json`:** Verify that all dependencies are correctly specified and installed using `expo install`.  Ensure that versions are compatible with your Expo SDK version.
* **Reviewing `app.json`:** Double-check the configurations in `app.json`, particularly plugin entries, to ensure that all referenced plugins are correctly installed and configured.
* **Linking Native Modules:** If you're using native modules, make sure they are properly linked using the correct Expo tools and instructions.
* **Cleaning and Rebuilding:** Sometimes, a simple `expo start --reset` or even a full project cleanup and rebuild can resolve issues caused by corrupted caches or temporary files.
* **Examining Logs:** Carefully analyze the full error messages and logs provided by the Expo CLI to identify the root cause.
